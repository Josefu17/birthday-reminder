# Birthday Reminder

### Work in Progress (Please come back later : ) )


TODO / FEATURES:
the email reminder (global rules, not configurable per-entry -> would be kind of overkill..)
- making the email address configurable? (receiver and the sender or just the receiver)

- deploy this on a raspberry pi and enjoy!
- add the final README at the end

DONE:
- CRUD operations on friends
- CRUD operations on rules to configure how many days before the birthday and at what hour to receive
