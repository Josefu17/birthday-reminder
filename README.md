# Birthday Reminder

### Work in Progress (Please come back later : ) )

TODO:
- configurable email address via the UI or the .env
- FRONTEND!
- address open todos
- deploy this on a raspberry pi and enjoy!
- add the final README at the end


FEATURES:
- the email reminder with different/multiple rules and friend/person entries
  - rules are configurable globally, not per-user basis (that'd be overkill.)

DONE:
- CRUD operations on friends
- CRUD operations on rules to configure how many days before the birthday and at what hour to receive
